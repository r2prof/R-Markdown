Some folks in Hollywood claim that movies with female characters make less in the box office, [FiveThirtyEight showed us that's not the case](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/). The `fivethirtyeight` package includes the dataset behind this analysis, and many more.

Let's take a look at the top 20 highest grossing films published after 1990, 80% of the films pass the Bechdel test[^1].

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("fivethirtyeight")
library("kableExtra")
bechdel %>%
  filter(year > 1990) %>%
  select(title, year, clean_test, binary, intgross_2013) %>%
  arrange(desc(intgross_2013)) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                latex_options = "striped")
```

When comparing the profitability of films, films that pass the Bechdel have a higher median profitability than any other category!

```{r}
bechdel %>%
  # filter(year > 1990) %>%
  mutate(profitability = intgross_2013 / budget_2013) %>%
  group_by(clean_test) %>%
  summarise(median_profitability = median(profitability, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(median_profitability))%>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

Boxplots provide more information that the summary statitics in the table above are able to communicate.

```{r}
bechdel %>%
  filter(year > 1990) %>%
  mutate(profitability = intgross_2013 / budget_2013) %>%
  filter(profitability < 50) %>%
  group_by(clean_test) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = clean_test,
             y = profitability)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```
