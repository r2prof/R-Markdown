## Were did ioslides come from?

The ioslides_presentation format is a clone of a slide deck template created by Google for their Google IO 2010 Conference.


- [Eric Bidelman's announcement of the slide template](https://plus.google.com/+EricBidelman/posts/LG93tTdJYLy).

- [Original source code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/io-2012-slides/)

Lot's of folks really loved the format, and duplicated it. There was a feeling that maybe Google would iterate on the format.

## Benefits of ioslides

There are many benefits of the ioslides format:

- Designed for readability (can't put too much on a slide).

- Works well on mobile devices

- Looks swish!

## Disadvantanges of ioslides

Some disadvantages of the format:

- Slides have two **fixed** resolutions, normal and widescreen (toggled by pressing `w`). This results in a lot of deadspace.

- Extremely difficult to customise text styles, `as.character("code formatting")` and arbitrary HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Slides overview

ioslides have a very useful "slide overview" accessible with the `o` key.

## ioslides unique feature: Highlighting code

There's a useful feature for highlighting specific parts of a code chunk with special comments:

\#\# \<b\><br>
library("tidyverse")<br>
\#\# \</b\>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
starwars %>%
  count(species) %>%
  ### <b>
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  ### </b>
  top_n(1)
```


## ioslides unique Feature: Presenter notes

Content can be hidden from your audience using *presenter notes*. These are displayed if the `p` key is pressed.

<div class="notes">
Notes are useful for a variety of reasons:

- Reminding speakers of talking points
- Showing your audience a footnote
- Including a webcomic
