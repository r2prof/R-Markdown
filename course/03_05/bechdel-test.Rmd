# The Bechdel Test

The Bechdel Test was devised by Alison Bechdel and poses the folowing questions:
  
- Does a movie have at least two women?
  
- Do any of these women talk to one another?
  
- Do they talk about something other than a man?

## Profitability analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com

FiveThirtyEight published an analysis of the correlation between passing the Bechdel test and a movie's gross worldiwde return: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/
```{r}
bechdel %>%
  head
```

Let's summarise their findings:
  
```{r bechdel-profitability}
bechdel %>%
	mutate(return = 100 * intgross_2013 / budget_2013) %>%
  group_by(clean_test) %>%
  summarise(median_return = median(return, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(median_return))
```
