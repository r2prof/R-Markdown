# The Bechdel Test

The Bechdel Test was devised by Alison Bechdel and poses the folowing questions:

- Does a movie have at least two women?

- Do any of these women talk to one another?

- Do they talk about something other than a man?

# Profitability analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com

FiveThirtyEight published an analysis of the correlation between passing the Bechdel test and a movie's gross worldiwde return: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

The dataset contains the following data:

```{r glimpse-bechdel}
bechdel %>%
  glimpse()
```

Let's consider the following properties of the data

```{r bechdel-return-calculation}
bechdel <- bechdel %>%
	mutate(return = 100 * intgross_2013 / budget_2013)
```

## Mean Return

```{r mean-return-clean-test}
bechdel %>%
  group_by(clean_test) %>%
  summarise(mean_return = mean(return, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_return))
```

## Median Return


```{r bechdel-profitability}
bechdel %>%
	mutate(return = 100 * intgross_2013 / budget_2013) %>%
  group_by(clean_test) %>%
  summarise(median_return = median(return, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(median_return))
